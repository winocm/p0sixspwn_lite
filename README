This versiom of p0sixspwn is very loosely designed for 6.1.6... and the other devices too. 
It worked after a fresh restore with the device unlocked and at the home screen, on success, your device
will reboot and install everything as needed. 

Please do not run this if you are already jailbroken, I do not care to add logic to check for that,
if you brick your device by doing something stupid, that is your problem.

Well, it works for the supported OSes, but this version is not supported.

Of course I use CoreOSMakefiles, why not?

Licensed under the same thing as the original p0sixspwn...

...No warranty is given. No complaints will be answered...
